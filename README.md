# Python-Testing-LLM-Modeling
 LLM from Scratch model
### This code I have written is inspired by a talk given by Andrej Karpath who has trained LLM's both in the past and currently.
### He previously worked for Tesla as Director of AI and is now currently with the Open AI project.
### Thank you for taking the time to skim through this. 
### Any questions please reach out to lamar.wells@smail.rasmussen.edu
